# Project Title: Custom Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT

**Description:**

This GitHub repository contains code for a custom sentiment analysis project leveraging the DistilBERT model, a lightweight version of BERT, implemented using TensorFlow and the Hugging Face Transformers library. The project focuses on classifying text data, particularly identifying spam messages. It comprises several components:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - The initial step involves loading and preprocessing the SMS Spam Collection dataset.
   - It involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, as well as encoding the text data using the DistilBERT tokenizer.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Utilizing TensorFlow, the project trains a DistilBERT-based neural network for sequence classification.
   - The model is trained on the preprocessed data, optimizing for performance metrics such as accuracy and efficiency.
   - Training parameters, such as epochs, batch sizes, and learning rates, can be adjusted to fine-tune the model.

3. **Evaluation and Testing:**
   - Once trained, the model is evaluated on a separate test dataset to assess its performance.
   - Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to gauge the model's effectiveness.

4. **Model Deployment:**
   - After successful training and evaluation, the model can be saved for future use or deployment in production environments.
   - The saved model can be integrated into applications or services for real-time sentiment analysis tasks.

5. **Documentation and Usage:**
   - The repository includes comprehensive documentation, including a README file detailing the project's purpose, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
   - Sample code snippets and explanations are provided to facilitate users in understanding and utilizing the project effectively.

**Key Features:**
- Utilizes the DistilBERT model for efficient sentiment analysis.
- Implemented using TensorFlow and the Hugging Face Transformers library.
